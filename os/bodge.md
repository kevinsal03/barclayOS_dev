# Stuff Added in During Build w/Interactive shell

* The /etc/os-release and /etc/lsb-release files are added during this time.
* The theme is added too
* Custom cs_info.py module in Cinnamon Settings (/usr/share/cinnamon/cinnamon-settigns)

The os-release and lsb-release will probably stay this way, other things will be implemented into packages and added on a custom repo shortly.

If you want to do this create a PR on the apt repo and a PR adding it here.
