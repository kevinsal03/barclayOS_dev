# OS Building Folder
This is where building of the operating system is done, each custom component will have its own folder in the directory above.
This OS is built using the Debian Live-Build package which allows us to quickly create ISO and IMG files to install onto x86 and amd64/x86_64 systems.
Releases will be on: [barclayOS repo](https://github.com/kevinsal03/barclayOS "barclayOS Repo on GitHub").
